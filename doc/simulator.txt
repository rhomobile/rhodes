# Using RhoSimulator

RhoSimulator allows to [run](#run-application-in-rhosimulator) Rhodes applications without lengthy build process and to [debug](#debugging-with-rhostudio) them in [RhoStudio](../rhostudio.tutorial). Currently RhoSimulator works on <b>Windows</b> only.

## Install RhoSimulator

If you have [Rhodes gem](install#rhodes-gem), then RhoSimulator is installed already.

If you would like to run RhoSimulator without Rhodes gem, [download it](http://rhosimulator.s3.amazonaws.com/RhoSimulator.zip), unzip and specify path to `rhosimulator.exe` at `rhodes/rhobuild.yml`:

        env: 
           paths:    
              rhosimulator: <RhoSimulator folder>

Alternatively you may [build](#build-rhosimulator) your own customized version of RhoSimulator as described [below](#build-rhosimulator).

## Run application in RhoSimulator

To run application in RhoSimulator just run in rhodes or application folder:

    #run RhoSimulator to simulate specific platform:
    rake run:android:rhosimulator 
    rake run:iphone:rhosimulator
    
    #bbver from build.yml will be used as System.get_property('os_version')
    rake run:bb:rhosimulator
    
    rake run:wm:rhosimulator
    rake run:wp:rhosimulator

    #run RhoSimulator to simulate 'UNKNOWN' platform:
    rake run:win32:rhosimulator

If you modified Rhodes application sources, just press 'Refresh' in RhoSimulator to reload application, i.e. generally no RhoSimulator restart is required.
The restart of RhoSimulator is required only if a model was added/modified or some code was added to the AppApplication class.

## Debugging with RhoStudio

### Prerequisites

* Install [RhoStudio](../rhostudio.tutorial)
* Install [RhoSimulator](#install-rhosimulator)
* Ensure your application is configured properly and successfully [runs in RhoSimulator](#run-application-in-rhosimulator) (from command line as described above)

### Starting debug session in RhoStudio

* Select Run » Debug Configurations... from top menu
* Find 'Rhodes Application' section on the left and add new (or modify existing) configuration
* On 'Common setting' tab select a project by clicking 'Browse...' button next to 'Project name:'
* Select 'Rho simulator' as the platform
* Click 'Apply' and then 'Debug'

### Debug capabilities

In present version of RhoStudio you may:

* Set breakpoints in Ruby code (.rb files)
* Watch variable values (global, local, class and instance) - currently auto-watch list is displayed in Expressions window
* View application log in Console window

## Build RhoSimulator

If you use custom native extensions, then running and debugging your applications in RhoSimulator requires a custom build.
Follow these instructions to build your own customized version of RhoSimulator.

### Preliminary steps

* Currently only <b>Visual Studio 2005 Service Pack 1</b> is supported
* Follow [Build for Windows - Prerequisites](build#build-for-windows), but do not install the Rhodes gem since you're going to use Rhodes SDK source.
* Get the `rhodes` source (if haven't done it already) as described [here](build#setup-rhodes-source-code). Don't forget to add the `bin` folder to your path, run `rhodes-setup` and update Rhodes SDK path in `build.yml` at your application root folder.
* First build the Qt libraries for VS 2005:
    * Download the Qt source:
        * Go to [http://qt.nokia.com/downloads](http://qt.nokia.com/downloads)
        * Choose the open source LGPL version
        * Under the Framework Only section choose Qt libraries for Windows (VS 2008)
        * Cancel automatically started download, and download the [source code](http://get.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.7.3.zip)
        * Extract the downloaded archive, e.g. into `C:\Qt\4.7.3-msvc2005`
    * Prepare to build the OpenSSL library:
        * Download [v0.9 source code](http://www.openssl.org/source/openssl-0.9.8r.tar.gz) from [www.openssl.org](http://www.openssl.org/) and extract the downloaded archive, e.g. into `C:\Qt\openssl-0.9.8r`
        * Install Perl interpreter (if it's not installed yet), e.g. [ActiveState Perl](http://www.activestate.com/activeperl)
    * Open Control Panel » System » Advanced system settings » Environment Variables and then:
        * Create new system variable `QTDIR` = `C:\Qt\4.7.3-msvc2005`
        * Add to the `PATH` variable: `C:\Qt\4.7.3-msvc2005\bin;C:\Qt\openssl-0.9.8r\bin` (it doesn't matter that `C:\Qt\openssl-0.9.8r\bin` folder does not exist yet)
        * Either close all command prompts and Visual Studio instances, or reboot the computer so the new settings take effect.
    * Open Visual Studio 2005 Command Prompt. This is accomplished using Start » All Programs » Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 » Visual Studio Tools » Visual Studio 2005 Command Prompt. Run in Visual Studio 2005 Command Prompt:

			> vcvarsall.bat x86
			> C:

    * To build OpenSSL library run in the same command prompt:

			> cd \Qt\openssl-0.9.8r
			> perl Configure VC-WIN32 --prefix=C:/Qt/openssl-0.9.8r
			> ms\do_masm
			> nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak
			> nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak install
			> nmake -f ms\ntdll.mak clean

    * To build Qt library run in the same command prompt:

			> cd \Qt\4.7.3-msvc2005
			> configure -opensource -platform win32-msvc2005
			  -nomake examples -nomake demos -nomake docs
			  -qt-libpng -qt-libjpeg -qt-libtiff -qt-gif -qt-libmng
			  -openssl-linked -I C:/Qt/openssl-0.9.8r/include
			  -L C:/Qt/openssl-0.9.8r/lib
			> nmake
			> nmake clean

      Be aware that it will take a while to build the Qt libraries from sources (maybe few hours or so). Particularly the `configure` command may run for a few minutes, and the `nmake` command may run for a few hours.
    * After the build process is completed exit Visual Studio 2005 Command Prompt

### Build with rake command:

	rake build:win32:rhosimulator

To run Rhodes applications in custom built RhoSimulator, please ensure that no `env:` » `paths:` » `rhosimulator:` line is present at your `rhobuild.yml` (if present, remove that line).

### Build in Visual Studio 2005:

* Open the solution:
  `C:\Rhomobile\rhodes\platform\wm\rhodes\rhodes.vcproj`
* Build solution for the configuration `SimulatorRelease|Win32`
* Specify the path to custom built RhoSimulator at `rhobuild.yml`:
        env: 
          paths:    
            rhosimulator: platform/wm/bin/Win32/rhodes/SimulatorRelease
