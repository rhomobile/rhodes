file_name.ext - The path to the file name, ending in the file name and extension.
media_type - Media type can be specified explicitly, or can be recognized from the file extension. Known file extensions are:

## Alert.show_popup( { :message, :title, :icon, :buttons, :callback } )

Bring the application up front and show a popup message.

:message – text displayed in the popup window.
