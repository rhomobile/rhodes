# RhoStudio Test Plan

## On Testing In General

RhoStudio is a multi-platform application and should act identically on all platforms (Windows and Mac OS X at present).
The only process that differs from platform to platform is an installation. So the installation tests are
described separately for each platform. All other tests should be performed on all platforms and yield the identical results.

Any deviation from the described behaviour is a possible bug and should be reported to the developers.

## On Virtual Machines

It is recommended to run all tests on virtual machines (e.g. using freeware [Oracle VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/)) on Windows XP, Windows 7, Mac OS 10.6 Snow Leopard, Mac OS 10.7 Lion.

1. Create virtual (guest) machine for selected operating system. Use the default settings for each virtual machine except:
   1. For Windows XP:
      - General > Basic > Version = Windows XP
      - Virtual HDD: 100 GB (dynamically allocated)
      - System > Motherboard > Base Memory = 1024 MB
      - Display > Video > Enable 3D Acceleration = check
      - Display > Video > Enable 2D Video Acceleration = check
      - Display > Video > Video Memory = 128 MB
   2. For Windows 7:
      - General > Basic > Version = Windows 7
      - Virtual HDD: 100 GB (dynamically allocated)
      - System > Motherboard > Base Memory = 2048 MB
      - Display > Video > Enable 3D Acceleration = check
      - Display > Video > Enable 2D Video Acceleration = check
      - Display > Video > Video Memory = 256 MB
   3. For Mac OS X:
      - General > Basic > Version = Mac OS X Server (64 bit)
      - Virtual HDD: 100 GB (dynamically allocated)
      - System > Motherboard > Base Memory = 2048 MB
      - Display > Video > Enable 3D Acceleration = check
      - Display > Video > Enable 2D Video Acceleration = uncheck
      - Display > Video > Video Memory = 128 MB

      NOTE: Mac OS X <b>Server</b> license <b>only</b> allows an installation on virtual machines, and that virtual machine must run on Apple hardware.
      This means that it's illegal to install regular Mac OS X to virtual machine even on Apple hardware.
      And of course it's completely illegal to install Mac OS X or Mac OS X Server to any non-Apple hardware
      (to virtual machine or as a primary operating system).

   NOTE: Pay attention to `System > Processor > Processors` property -- if you plan to connect USB devices directly to virtual machine, set the number of processors strictly to 1
   (this is a workaround for the bug in VirtualBox). Also for USB pass-thru you need to install [VirtualBox Extension Pack](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and,
   if VirtualBox is installed on Linux host, then you need to add all users runnung virtual machines to `vboxusers` group.

2. Install desired operating system to virtual machine using original installation media (CD or DVD) and product license key
   (see VirtualBox help and documentation for details on guest operating systems installation).

3. Install all updates, service packs and official patches for installed OS.

4. Install all latest avaiable SDKs for supported mobile platforms:

   1. Install latest Android SDK and NDK. Do not forget to run Android SDK Manager to download and install all latest tools, platforms and APIs.
      Don't use path with spaces, install SDK and NDK to something like `C:\Anrdoid\android-sdk` and `C:\Anrdoid\android-ndk` on Windows
      and to something like `/Developer/SDKs/android-sdk` and `/Developer/SDKs/android-ndk` on Mac.
   2. On Windows: install Visual Studio 2008 and Windows Mobile 6 Professional SDK Refresh
      (don't forget to run Microsoft Update after Visual Studio installation to apply all latest updates, service packs and fixes).

      NOTE: On Windows 7 you should install Windows Mobile Device Center (WMDC) in order to be able to connect to Windows Mobile devices and emulators.
      On Windows XP ActiveSync will be installed automatically.

      NOTE: To be able to connect to Windows Mobile emulators go to 'Connection settings' of WMDC/ActiveSync,
      check 'Allow connections to one of the following' and select 'DMA'.

      NOTE: Make sure `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\vcpackages` is added to the system-wide PATH environment variable.

5. Shutdown virtual machine and create a snapshot.

6. Before testing of each new version of RhoStudio restore the virtual machine state from this snapshot.

7. After release of the update, service pack or official patch for the operating system and/or mobile platforms SDKs:
   - restore the virtual machine state from latest snapshot;
   - install the updates, service packs and/or patches;
   - shutdown virtual machine and create new snapshot;
   - delete old (previous) snapshot.

Thus you will always have an up-to-date clean fresh installation of each operating system with all required SDKs for testing purposes.

NOTE: Never create a snapshot of crashed or abnormally exited virtual machine! Always restore previous good state
from latest snapshot, install neccesary updates/service-packs/patches, create new snapshot, and delete previous snapshot.

NOTE: Deletion of previous snapshots lets you save a lot of free disk space on a physical (host) machine especially for Windows virtual machines (guests).

## Testing Windows installation

Take just installed Windows XP or Windows 7 with all latest Microsoft Service Packs and hotfixes applied, Android SDK, Android NDK, Visual Studio 2008, and Windows Mobile 6 Professional SDK Refresh installed.

### Installation failure test on Windows without JRE

1. Download and run RhoStudioInstallerX.Y.Z.exe
2. Go through the installation wizard until message appears: "Java Runtime Environment could not be found on your computer.
   Please install Java Runtime Environment before RhoStudio" (if this message does not appear and install starts,
   then it's a bug).

### Installation success test on Windows with JRE

1. Install the latest JDK (Java Development Kit). Make sure that full path to `bin` folder of JDK is added to system-wide PATH environment variable.
   NOTE: Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installation would be enough at this stage, but RhoStudio needs JDK to build applications for Android,
   so it's logical to install the full JDK here.

2. Run RhoStudioInstallerX.Y.Z.exe again.
3. Go through the installation wizard, leave all settings at their defaults.
4. Installation must start then. It takes some time.
5. On the last installation step the Git installer should appear. Install Git leaving all default settings.
   When it's done, click `Finish` button. If you didn't unselect <b>View ReleaseNotes.rtf</b>, then the Release Notes window will appear -- just close it.
6. On the last screen of RhoStudio installation wizard click `Finish`. If you didn't unselect <b>View Readme</b>, then `README.html` will be opened in the separate default browser window.
7. Check that `RhoStudio` group appears on `Start Menu` and contains `RhoStudio` and `Uninstall RhoStudio` shortcuts.
8. Open RhoStudio by clicking `RhoStudio` shortcut in the `RhoStudio` group on the `Start Menu`.
   NOTE: On Windows the security dialog may appear asking you to 'Keep blocking' or to 'Unblock' RhoStudio --
   agree to unblock it.

## Testing Mac OS X installation

Take a fresh clean installation of Mac OS X with all available Software Updates (excluding Java), latest Android SDK and Android NDK installed.

### RhoStudioInstaller appearance test

1. Download and open RhoStudioInstallerX.Y.Z.dmg
2. You will see `RhoStudio -> Applications` in the first row (top part of the window), and `README.html`, 'Install gems', 'Install gems on rvm', and 'samples' below (on the next rows).

### Installation failure test on Mac OS X without Xcode

1. Open 'Install gems' shorcut. The Terminal window will appear.
2. If asked for a password, enter the password.
3. The message will appear: "Please install building tools"

### Installation failure test on Mac OS X without Java

1. Install latest available Xcode with iOS SDK.
2. Open 'Install gems' shorcut again.
3. If asked for a password, enter the password.
4. The message will appear: "Please install java development kit"

### Installation success test on Mac OS X with Xcode

1. Open Terminal application and type:

       :::term
       $ java

   The window will appear asking you about installation of Java -- agree and proceed JDK installation.

2. Open 'Install gems' shorcut again.

3. If asked for password, enter your password.

4. When `[Process completed]` appears, close this window and open new Terminal window.

5. Type:

       :::term
       $ gem list

   Make sure the following gems are on the list:
   - activesupport
   - bundler
   - diff-lcs
   - extlib
   - highline
   - i18n
   - json
   - macaddr
   - mime-types
   - multi_json
   - nokogiri
   - rack
   - rack-protection
   - rake
   - redis
   - redis-namespace

   - rhomobile-debug
   - rubyzip
   - sinatra
   - systemu
   - templater
   - tilt
   - uuid
   - uuidtools
   - vegas

6. Drag `RhoStudio` icon to `Applications` icon. The 'Copy' progress window will appear. It will copy approximately 300 MB and 2,000 files.

7. Drag 'samples' folder to the desktop -- it will be used in the further tests.

8. To launch RhoStudio open Finder window, go to Applications, open `RhoStudio` folder and then open `RhoStudio` shortcut.

## Testing RhoStudio

When you open the RhoStudio it asks a path to create (or open existing) `workspace` folder -- leave this path at its default and click 'OK'
(you may wish to check 'Use this as the default and do not ask again' to avoid unnecessary stop during RhoStudio launch in the future).

### Rhomobile Preferences editing failure test

1. Go to `Window > Preferences` (on Windows) or `RhoStudio > Preferences` (on Mac) in the top menu.
2. Click on `Rhomobile` node, the message will appear: "Rhodes location is undefined. Please, open/create at least one Rhodes Application project".

### Rhodes Application project creation test

1. Go to `File > New > Project` in the top menu.
2. Expand `Rhomobile` node, select `Rhodes application` and click `Next`.
3. Leave all settings at their defaults and click `Finish`. Wait until the wizard finishes application generation.
4. Something similar to the following output should appear in the Console window:
       Generating with app generator:

       [ADDED]   RhodesApplication1/app/Settings
       [ADDED]   RhodesApplication1/public
       [ADDED]   RhodesApplication1/app/loading.png
5. Check that project `RhodesApplication1` appeared at `Project Explorer` window.

### Rhomobile Preferences editing success test

1. Go to `Window > Preferences` (on Windows) or `RhoStudio > Preferences` (on Mac) in the top menu.
2. Click on `Rhomobile` node, 'Rhodes rhobuild.yml preferences' page containing 'Java path' textbox should appear.
3. Enter the correct path to `bin` folder of the installed JDK (typically `/Library/Java/Home/bin` on Mac,
   and the `bin` folder of JDK installed during installation tests on Windows, e.g. `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0\bin`).
4. Expand `Rhomobile` node and enter correct paths to 'Android SDK' and 'Android NDK' on `Android` tab,
   e.g. `C:\Anrdoid\android-sdk` and `C:\Anrdoid\android-ndk` on Windows
   and `/Developer/SDKs/android-sdk` and `/Developer/SDKs/android-ndk` on Mac.
5. On Windows go to `Windows Mobile` tab and set a correct path to 'Cab wizard'.
6. Click `OK` to finish editing and apply changes.
7. Open `rhobuild.yml` (from the Rhodes gem home folder) in any text editor/viewer and make sure
   it contains the correct paths you just entered, e.g. on Windows:
       env:
         paths:
           java: C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.7.0/bin
           android: C:/Android/android-sdk
           android-ndk: C:/Android/android-ndk
           cabwiz: C:/Program Files/Windows Mobile 6 SDK/Tools/CabWiz
   On Mac, e.g.:
       env:
         paths:
           java: /Library/Java/Home/bin
           android: /Developer/SDKs/android-sdk
           android-ndk: /Developer/SDKs/android-ndk


   NOTE: `rhobuild.yml` is located at the Rhodes gem home folder.
   Typically its full path is `/Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/rhodes-x.y.z/rhobuild.yml` on Mac and
   `C:\RhoStudio\ruby\lib\ruby\gems\1.8\gems\rhodes-x.y.z\rhobuild.yml` on Windows.

### Rhodes Application import test

1. Go to `File > New > Project` in the top menu.
2. Expand `Rhomobile` node, select `Rhodes application` and click `Next`.
3. Check 'Create application from existing sources'.
4. To select 'Application folder' click 'Browse...' and open:
   - on Windows: `C:\RhoStudio\samples\rhodes-system-api-samples`
   - on Mac: `Desktop > samples > rhodes-system-api-samples`
5. Click `Finish`. Wait until the wizard finishes application import.
6. Check that project `rhodes-system-api-samples` appeared at `Project Explorer` window.

## Testing RhoStudio Debugger

### Debugging new application

1. Go to `Run > Debug Configurations` in the top menu.
2. Pop-up context menu on `Rhodes Application` node and choose `New`.
3. Select `RhodesApplication1` using `Browse` button of 'Project name' textbox.
4. Select any 'Platform' and version (e.g. 'Android', '3.0').
5. Click `Debug` button.
6. RhoSimulator running new empty application should appear. There should be 'RhodesApplication1' title, 'Login' button, and 'Add link here...' text below
   in main RhoSimulator window. A separate Web Inspector window should be on the right of the main Rhosimulator window.
   NOTE: On Windows the security dialog may appear asking you to 'Keep blocking' or to 'Unblock' RhoSimulator --
   it must be unblocked in order all further tests to work.

7. Switch back to RhoStudio. There must be 'Debug' perspective opened by RhoStudio automatically.
8. Make sure that Console window shows rhodes application log. The last lines at this point should look somewhat like this:
       I 10/31/2011 20:37:13:295 00000b3c   MainWindow| addToolbarButton: Label: '';Action: 'back'

       I 10/31/2011 20:37:13:982 00000b3c   MainWindow| WebView: loaded
9. Switch to 'RhoStudio' perspective.
10. Open file `RhodesApplication1\app\Settings\controller.rb` -- its Ruby code must be syntax-highlighted appropriately.
11. Go to line 10 and toggle breakpoint.
12. Switch to RhoSimulator window and choose `Main > Options` in the top menu.
13. Switch to RhoStudio and choose 'Debug' perspective.
14. The execution must be stopped at the breakpoint in `controller.rb` line 10.
15. Look at the Variables window -- there must be a complete list of Ruby variables with current values in the following order:
    - instance variables (name starts with '@')
    - global variables (name starts with '$')
    - local variables (name starts with latin letter) -- at this breakpoint there must be no local variables
    - class variables (name starts with '@@') -- at this breakpoint there must be no class variables

    Notice that there is no `@msg` variable on the list.
16. Choose `Run > Step Over` in the top menu.
17. The execution must stop at line 11 of `controller.rb`.
18. Notice that `@msg` variable appeared on the list of variables with 'nil' value.
19. Close RhoSimulator main window.
20. The status of the `RhodesApplication1` in the Debug window of RhoStudio must be `<terminated>` now.
    NOTE: On Mac OS X this will not happen -- it's a known issue. Choose `Run > Terminate` from the top menu to stop the debug session.

21. Switch to `RhoStudio` perspective.
22. Close `RhodesApplication1` project (select it in Project Explorer window and choose `Project > Close` in the top menu).

### Debugging imported application

1. Go to `Run > Debug Configurations` in the top menu.
2. Select previously created configuration under the `Rhodes Application` node
   (most likely it's named `New_configuration` if you didn't change the name) and
   choose `rhodes-system-api-samples` as 'Project name' using `Browse` button.
3. Click `Debug` button.
4. RhoSimulator running `rhodes-system-api-samples` application will appear.
5. Switch back to RhoStudio. There must be 'Debug' perspective opened by RhoStudio automatically.
6. Make sure that Console window shows rhodes application log (see p.8 of [previous test](#testing-rhostudio-debugger)).
7. Open file `rhodes-system-api-samples\app\JsonTest\controller.rb` -- its Ruby code must be syntax-highlighted appropriately.
8. Go to line 14 and toggle breakpoint.
9. Switch to RhoSimulator window, click on `Json test` link at the bottom of the page, and on the next page click `Parse test.json`.
10. Switch to RhoStudio and choose 'Debug' perspective.
11. The execution must be stopped at the breakpoint in `controller.rb` line 14.
12. Look at the Variables window -- there must be a complete list of Ruby variables with current values in the following order:
    - instance variables (name starts with '@')
    - global variables (name starts with '$')
    - local variables (name starts with latin letter) -- at this breakpoint there must be 4 local variables having 'nil' values:
      - file_name
      - content
      - parsed
      - gen
    - class variables (name starts with '@@') -- at this breakpoint there must be no class variables
13. Choose `Run > Step Into` in the top menu.
17. The execution must stop at line 15 of `controller.rb`.
18. Notice that the `file_name` variable has a non-nil value, e.g. `C:/RhoStudio/samples/rhodes-system-api-samples/app/JsonTest/test.json` on Windows.
19. Toggle breakpoint on line 24 and choose `Run > Resume` in the top menu.
20. The execution must stop at line 24 of `controller.rb`.
21. Take a look at Variables window and make sure that all four local variables (`file_name`, `content`, `parsed`, `gen`) have non-nil values.
22. Choose `Run > Terminate` in the top menu.
23. RhoSimulator and Web Inspector windows must close automatically and the status of the
    `rhodes-system-api-samples` application in the Debug window of RhoStudio must be
    `<terminated>` now.
24. Switch to 'RhoStudio' perspective and close the RhoStudio. 'Confirm Exit' dialog will appear --
    you may check 'Always exit without prompt' and click 'OK'.

## Testing RhoStudio with device emulators

This test must be repeated for each device emulator and each major version available on the testing platform, i.e. at this time:

- on Windows:
  - Windows Mobile 6 Professional Emulator
  - Android 2.3.3 and 3.2 Emulator
    NOTE: <b>Temporary workaround:</b> To run Android tests successfully on Windows at present you need to patch `build.yml` file in `rhodes-system-api-samples` project.
    In RhoStudio open `build.yml` file located in the root folder of `rhodes-system-api-samples` project,
    switch to source code using `build.yml` tab at the bottom of the editor window, find the `android` section and
    comment out `rainbow` extension like this:

        android:
          extensions:
            - barcode
            # - rainbow
            - nfc

- on Mac OS X:
  - Android 2.3.3 and 3.2 Emulator
  - iPhone 4.3 and 5.0 Simulator
  NOTE: To change the version of iPhone simulator open `build.yml` located in the root folder of
  `rhodes-system-api-samples` project, switch to source using `build.yml` tab at the bottom of the editor window,
  find `iphone` section and change `sdk` to either `iphonesimulator4.3` or `iphonesimulator5.0` -- it should look like this:

        iphone:
          sdk: iphonesimulator5.0

Now open RhoStudio as described in installation success tests and begin testing.

1. Make sure the `rhodes-system-api-samples` project is opened.
2. Go to `Run > Run Configurations` in the top menu.
3. Select previously created configuration under the `Rhodes Application` node
   (most likely it's named `New_configuration` if you didn't change the name).
4. Make sure the 'Project name' is `rhodes-system-api-samples` (if not, choose it using `Browse` button).
5. Choose the desired 'Platform' and version.
6. Select `Simulator` as 'Simulator type'.
7. Check 'Clean before build' checkbox.
8. Click `Run` button.
9. Console window should display `Rhomobile build console` with lengthy output of building process. It takes time.
   Do not overload the machine (nor physical, nor virtual) with other resource-intensive tasks.
10. The device emulator will be started as soon as the build succeed. Wait for the application to load into the emulator.
11. The application will start on the emulator automatically and the Console window of the RhoStudio
    should display rhodes application log right now.
12. Play with the application to make sure it works (see [system-api-samples section](/rhodes/release#test-procedures)
    of rhodes release test procedures to get an idea of what to check).
13. Close emulator
14. Close `rhodes-system-api-samples` project and open `RhodesApplication1` project.
15. Go to `Run > Run Configurations` in the top menu and change 'Project name' to `RhodesApplication1` using `Browse` button.
16. Repeat steps 8-11.
17. Click on 'Login' button to get to login screen, click on settings icon to get to settings screen.
    Make sure the application works and looks native on this mobile platform.
18. Close `RhodesApplication1` project and open `rhodes-system-api-samples` project.

## Testing RhoStudio with devices

This test must be repeated for all different devices you have on hand.

1. Reset the device and set it to factory defaults.
2. Connect the device via USB to the host machine.
3. In virtual (guest) machine menu check `Devices > USB Devices > ...connected device...`
4. Do all the steps of [previous test](#testing-rhostudio-with-device-emulators) except step 6 where you should select `Device` as a 'Simulator type' (instead of `Simulator`).
5. After you finish uncheck `Devices > USB Devices > ...connected device...` in virtual (guest) machine menu.
6. Disconnect the device.
