Want to add features to Rhodes?  Found a bug that you want report or fix?

## Report Rhodes Issues
Please report bugs/features/enhancements to the [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/rhomobile).

## Run Rhodes Specs
First run the rhodes specs to make sure your environment is up-to-date for development (currently the specs only run on OSX):

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/forking/) the [Rhodes repository](http://github.com/rhomobile/rhodes).
2. Clone your new repo: 

		$ git clone git://github.com/<yourhandle>/rhodes.git
		$ cd rhodes
		$ bin/rhodes-setup
		$ rake run:allspecs #=> runs rhodes framework_spec and phone_spec targets


If everything passes (pending specs are OK), then your environment is ready for development.  If you have trouble installing a particular gem or the specs just won't run properly, please feel free to ping the [google group](mailto:rhomobile@googlegroups.com rhomobile) or [hop on IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=rhomobile) to chat with other Rhodes developers.

## Contributing your Patch
Now that you're environment is ready, make your changes!

1. Create a topic branch:
		$ git checkout -b cool_new_feature
2. Write tests([example](http://github.com/rhomobile/rhodes/blob/a905e9c9781bfe6e5003e8c8a11cd5418b08df73/spec/framework_spec/app/spec/rhom_object_spec.rb#L239))
3. Make changes...
4. Add relevant documentation(RDoc, update the README if relevant)
5. Push to your branch:
		$ git push origin cool_new_feature
6. Send a note to the [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/rhomobile)

That's it!  We recommend following [these ruby style guidelines](http://github.com/chneukirchen/styleguide/blob/master/RUBY-STYLE) when coding.

If you are interested us using your patch to Rhodes you will need to submit a  [contribution agreement](http://rhomobile.com/community/contributing/) to us.

## Automated Tests
Rhodes includes automated tests that can (and should) be run periodically against the codebase if you're modifying the Rhodes framework itself.

### Install Rhodes
The automated tests are a part of the Rhodes project on GitHub. To obtain the Rhodes source code and access the automated tests, follow the instructions in the [Setup Rhodes Source Code](http://rhodocs.rhohub.com/rhodes/build#setup-rhodes-source-code) section. You will find two automated test sets under rhodes/spec/. One is called phone_spec, the other is framework_spec.

### Running Tests
Assuming you have already downloaded the necessary SDKs (instructions can be found [here](http://rhodocs.rhohub.com/rhodes/build)), all you need to do is execute the appropriate rake task. To execute the phone_spec, for example, you can do the following in Terminal:

    :::term
    $ cd rhodes/spec/phone_spec
    $ rake run:platform:spec

Where platform is "android" to run it for Android, "iphone" for iPhone, "bb" for BlackBerry. As a shortcut, you can also execute any of the following supported tasks:

    :::term
    $ rake run:iphone:spec           # Runs spec tests for the current directory
    $ rake run:iphone:phone_spec     # Runs spec tests for rhodes/spec/phone_spec
    $ rake run:iphone:framework_spec # Runs spec tests for rhodes/spec/framework_spec

    $ rake run:android:spec          # Runs spec tests for the current directory
    $ rake run:android:phone_spec    # Runs spec tests for rhodes/spec/phone_spec

    $ rake run:bb:spec               # Runs spec tests for the current directory
    $ rake run:bb:phone_spec         # Runs spec tests for rhodes/spec/phone_spec

Rhomobile performs continuous testing of the framework_spec on iPhone and the phone_spec on iPhone and BlackBerry via a customized branch of the CIJoe project. Support for the Android phone_spec is currently functional but under development.
