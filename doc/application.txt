# Rhodes Application

## App structure
The Rhodes application generator generates a basic application from the "rhodes app" option. It will generate subdirectories and controller and template files when specifying a model and actions. Please refer to the [Rhodes generator](rhodes_generator) documentation for more detailed information about the Rhodes directory structure.

### Example Directory Structure
As an example, /sugar could be the root folder for an application that provides mobile access to SugarCRM. The app's root directory will contain a few .erb files, depending on the app's functionality. At the very least there will be an index.erb file that serves as the default landing page. This default landing page will typically have links to the controllers for some of the data models, and is not associated with any specific controller. In case the application needs a default landing page associated with a controller, it is recommended to create a model/controller/view folder and use an action on this controller as a default start path. To do that, edit the start_path property in the [Configuration]() framework configuration file.

## Model/View/Controller
By convention, files for each Model include a controller, a model class and view templates described below.

### Controller
Developer may create any number of controller actions by simple defining new methods in the controller class. Each action associated with url and can be performed by calling that url from the View in the WebView control. WebView control is a Web Browser imbedded in the application UI.  

For example, if you have Account Model your controller actions will be in account_controller.rb file. To defined action 'list' you will create method 'list' in the account_controller.rb file:
	:::ruby
	def list
		#implement required business logic here
		#...
		#return result to the browser
		render :action => :list
	end  

From the View list action will be available as 'Account/list' url.	

Each generated model controller has several actions to perform basic CRUD (create, read, update and delete) on the object. These actions are:

* index - lists all objects
* new - displays the editing form for creating a new object
* create - actually creates the object
* edit - edits an existing object
* update - updates properties of the object
* show - views the object
* delete - deletes the object

Generated set of actions (and the associated URL paths) follows the Rails scaffolding pattern for creating CRUD actions for objects and the associated "map resources" convention for routing to those actions. 

### Model
To store data locally Rhodes uses Sqlite on iPhone, Android, and Windows Mobile. On Blackberry version up to 5.0 Rhodes uses Hsql. On version 5.0 and higher it is possible to use Sqlite or Hsql. To access and manipulate stored data you may use [Rhom](rhom). Rhom is a mini ORM (object relational mapper) for Rhodes. It provides a high level way to make the local database easier to program to.  

By convention, your model class is located in the model's folder. For the model "UserBase" the file would be called "user_base.rb"

Example of added upper_name method to the model:

	:::ruby
	class UserBase
		include Rhom::PropertyBag
	  	#add model specific code here
	  	def upper_name
	    	self.name.upcase
	  	end
	end

You may define PropertyBag model or FixedSchema models. In first case model object may have any number of attributes and developer may create them on the fly by assigning values to an attribute. Fixed schema is more rigid and attributes of such objects should be defined at compile time. But Fixed Schema objects will require significantly less space on the target device. See more details about Rhom [here](rhom).

### Views (Templates)
Each controller action usually associated with a View template. The .erb files mentioned above are the templates used for views. Rhodes follows the Rails convention for template naming.

* index.erb - lists the data model objects
* edit.erb - lets you edit the object
* show.erb - shows the object's attribute values
* new.erb - creates a new object

These files are all created by the [rhodes generator](rhodes_generator). Inside the template, any valid HTML, JavaScript, and Ruby can be used, with Ruby code enclosed in <% and %> tags. See more information about ERB [here](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/erb/rdoc/).

To send View to the browser, use render method in your controller. For example, to render list.erb, make following call in your controller:

	:::ruby
	render :action => :list 
	
Rhodes framework will load list.erb template, process it, and send resulted HTML to the browser.	

## AppApplication class
To coordinate application startup Rhodes framework introduced Application class. This class persistent all the time while app is running and across all requests to the controller actions. You can store session data here. To get an instance of the AppApplication object in your controller, use:

	:::ruby
	::Rho.get_app

AppAplication class defined in the application.rb file:
	:::ruby
	class AppApplication < Rho::RhoApplication
	  def initialize
	  	# put initialization code here
	  end
	end
	
You may listen for activation/deactivation/upgrade events if you define following methods on AppApplication class. 

Method on_activate_app will be invoked after application is activated. 
	:::ruby
	def on_activate_app
		# put your application activation code here
	end 

Method on_deactivate_app will be invoked before application goes to background.
	:::ruby
	def on_deactivate_app
	  	# Don't call any UI operations here, they'll be ignored
	  	# For example, WebView.refresh

	  	# to stop sync background thread call 
		# SyncEngine.stop_sync; SyncEngine.set_pollinterval(0)
	
	  	# To stop local web server when application switched to 
		# background return "stop_local_server"
	  	# return "stop_local_server" 
	end

Method on_config_conflicts may be called after application was upgraded. If application bundle contain rhoconfig with properties modified locally on the phone conflicts is a hash name to array of conflicted values(old local value, new upgrade value). By default local values are kept in place but you may overwrite configuration with new values and any other steps required for your application upgrade.
	:::ruby
	def on_config_conflicts(conflicts)
	    # puts "on_config_conflicts: #{conflicts}"
	end

## View Layouts

Rhodes supports a layout mechanism based on ERB templates. The default layout template is called "layout.erb" and is located in the application root folder.  Unless overridden, this layout is rendered on all non-Ajax requests.

### Customizing Layouts

If you would like to override or customize layout behavior, you can call the render function with the following parameters:

	:::ruby
	render :action => 'index', :layout => 'mycustomlayout', :use_layout_on_ajax => false

The first argument is the action you would like to render.  Next is the (optional) layout name, which assumes the application root as a base directory.  In the above example, Rhodes would look for a file called "mycustomlayout.erb" in the application root directory (you also may use :layout => false to disable the use of a layout template).  The use_layout_on_ajax argument tells Rhodes whether or not to use the layout on Ajax calls (default is false). 

You can call the layout method on the controller to overwrite the default layout name:

	:::ruby
	layout :mycustomlayout

This will force the render call to use mycustomlayout.erb in place of the default layout file for all actions of this controller.

## Application Helpers
Few helper methods defined as part of the Rhodes framework. There are just a few of them because Rhodes framework designed for mobile environment where size is still of some concern and we tried to keep framework as tight as possible. 

Generated application comes with number of other helpers (see app/helpers folder). These helpers are not used by the framework internally and may be modified/deleted/extended at will.

### link_to
Examples of how to use the link_to method:

	link_to "Visit Other Site", "http://www.rhomobile.com/"
	==> <a href="http://www.rhomobile.com/" >Visit Other Site</a>
  
	link_to "Help", { :action => "help" }
	==> <a href="/app/model/help" >Help</a>
  
	link_to "Delete", { :action => "delete", :id => '{12}' }
	==> <a href="/app/model/{12}/delete"  onclick="
		var f = document.createElement('form'); 
	    f.style.display = 'none'; this.parentNode.appendChild(f); 
		f.method = 'POST'; f.action = this.href; f.submit(); 
		return false;">Delete</a>
 
	link_to "Show", { :action => "show", :id => '{12}'},
	"style=\"height:4px;width:7px;border-width:0px;\"" 
	==> <a href="/app/model/{12}/show" 
		style="height:4px;width:7px;border-width:0px;">Show</a>
  
	link_to "Delete", { :action => "delete", :id => '{12}' }, 
	"class=\"delete_link\""
	==> <a href="/app/model/{12}/delete" class="delete_link" 
		onclick="var f = document.createElement('form'); 
	    f.style.display = 'none'; this.parentNode.appendChild(f); 
		f.method = 'POST'; f.action = this.href; f.submit();
		return false;\">Delete</a>"
  
	link_to "Invite",:action => :invite, 
	:query => {:name=>'John Smith','address'=>"http://john.smith.com"}
	==> <a href="/app/model/invite?
		name=John%20Smith&address=http%3A%2F%2Fjohn.smith.com">
		Invite</a>

### url_for
Examples of how to use the url_for method:
    
	url_for '/some_url'
	==> /some_url
    
When generating a new URL, missing values may be filled in from the current request's parameters.
For example, if the application name or model are not specified in the call parameters, they would be filled from the request.
    
	url_for :action => :index
	==> /app/model
  
	url_for :action => :create
	==> /app/model
 
	url_for :action => :new
	==> /app/model/new
  
	url_for :action => :show, :id => '{12}'
	==> /app/model/{12}/show

	url_for :model => :another_model, 
	:action => :show, :id => '{12}'
	==> /app/another_model/{12}/show
  
	url_for :controller => :another_controller, 
	:action => :show, :id => '{12}'
	==> /app/another_controller/{12}/show
  
	url_for :application => :another_app, 
	:model => :another_model, :action => :show, :id => '{12}'
	==> /another_app/another_model/{12}/show
   
	url_for :action => :create, :query => 
	{:name => 'John Smith', 'address' => "http://john.smith.com"}
	==> /app/model?name=John%20Smith&address=http%3A%2F%2Fjohn.smith.com
  
	url_for :action => :show, :id => '{12}', :fragment => "an-anchor" 
	==> /app/model/{12}/show#an-anchor


## Per Platform Files

On a per platform basis, you can use alternative files for any given file in your 'app' or 'public' folder. To do this, make a second file with the platform in the name of the file. 

For example, to replace these files on the Android platform:

		default.css
		index.erb

All you need to do is add the two files:

		default.android.css
		index.android.erb

Note that you must still have the base file present for it to be replaced on a platform.

Valid platform names are:

* android
* wm
* bb
* iphone
