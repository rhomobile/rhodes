	<MODULE name="Device" parent="Rho">
        <HELP_OVERVIEW>The Device API provides access to some device level functionality that is only available on Symbol devices such as suspend, calibrate, powerOff, wake, reboot etc.</HELP_OVERVIEW>
        <MORE_HELP>
## Enabling the API
In order to use this API you must include the following extension in your `build.yml`.
    :::ruby
    extensions: ["symboldevice"]

The `symboldevice` extension is also included automatically if you specify the following in your `build.yml`
    :::ruby
    app_type: "rhoelements"

NOTE: If you are building a Windows Mobile or Windows CE app with this API, you must set your app_type as "rhoelements" in your build.yml as shown [here](../guide/build_config#other-build-time-settings).

## JavaScript Usage
Be sure to review the [JavaScript API Usage](/guide/api_js) guide for important information about using this API in JavaScript.

## Ruby Usage
Be sure to review the [Ruby API Usage](/guide/api_ruby) guide for important information about using this API in Ruby.
